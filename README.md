#Open Discloure Philly#

A project to improve access to/report on/organize Philadelphia's public campaign finance data.

Based on [Open Disclosure Oakland](opendisclosure.io), but currently not using any code directly.

Grabbing Philly campaign finance data from the city's [ftp store](ftp://ftp.phila-records.com/). Also check out the [Board of Ethics page](http://www.phila.gov/ethicsboard/campaignfinance/Pages/default.aspx) and the [Reports page](http://www.phila.gov/records/campaignfinance/CampaignFinance.html).

###Project Status/TODO:###

- [] Parse raw data and get it into a database
	- [x] Get a sample contrib.txt file into a DB
	- [] Do it for other types (expenses, receipts) and committees
